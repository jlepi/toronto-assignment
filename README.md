Please include:
- "Open Sans" from Google Fonts - regular and bold.
- a 1100px wide wrapper.
- a full bleed background colour (#d5d5d5).
- an overlay on hover of images (hint: try using a "to bottom right" linear gradient and percentages to get the triangle look!).
- font awesome icons in the footer, make sure these are links. Don't forget to include the "visuallyhidden" class to make sure these links are accessible. They should also have a hover state, it could be a colour change or something else, or a combination.
